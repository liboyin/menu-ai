This file is intended for AI agents.

# Meta Guidelines

- If not running in a Docker container, stop and confirm with the user before continuing.
- State assumptions explicitly. When you notice ambiguity (e.g. two conflicting patterns, or a design choice with no stated rationale), confirm with the user before continuing.
- Prefer spawning subagents to keep the main context window clean.
- Before considering a task done, re-check that all instructions in this file are followed.

# Documentation Guidelines

- `README.md` describes project architecture, dataflow, design decisions, and assumptions for both humans and AI agents. It is the WHY document and must not be mixed with HOW content.
- In contrast, `AGENTS.md`, `UAT_PLAN.md`, `UAT_SETUP.md`, and `DEPLOYMENT.md` are HOW documents.
- New or modified functions/methods in non-test scripts require TSDoc/JSDoc comments; unit test functions require a one-line description (typically the `it(...)`/`test(...)` title).

# Implementation Guidelines

- Implement only what was asked; do not add features or unrelated refactors.
- Prefer the simplest implementation. Each function/class/module must have a single responsibility and a well-defined interface; other SOLID principles may be relaxed in favor of simplicity.
- Keep implementations easy to test with minimal mocking. Prefer pure functions, and isolate side effects where practical.
- Use up-to-date features from languages, libraries, and frameworks.
- Commit each functionally independent change once fully implemented, tested, and documented.
- Commit messages must follow this template:

```
<Your name: Claude/Codex/Gemini/...>: <one-line summary>

<One paragraph describing the change in detail. If more than one paragraph is necessary, the change can probably be broken down.>
```

# Test Guidelines

Tests must encode WHY behavior matters, not just WHAT it does. A test that does not fail when business logic changes is wrong.

After any code change, all of the following must pass:

```bash
npm run test:coverage
npm run lint
```

Coverage must be at least 85% overall across statements, branches, functions, and lines (enforced by Jest; see `coverageThreshold` in `jest.config.js`).

When writing unit tests:

- Order test functions to match the source file's function order.
- Import the module under test as `import * as testee from './my-module'`; call functions as `testee.functionName` and mock attributes via `jest.spyOn(testee, 'attribute')` (or `jest.mocked(...)` for module-level mocks declared with `jest.mock(...)`).

# Review Guidelines

Review your own changes before committing:

- Does it achieve the intended purpose?
- Is it bug-free?
- Can it be simplified?
- Are there design flaws or anti-patterns?
- Are there design choices that make testing or validation unnecessarily difficult?
- Anything else a senior reviewer would push back on? (Use judgment)

Fix trivial issues. For others, stop and confirm with the user.
